## Setting up environment

I have used Conda to create isolated environments and package management. Please install it for Linux from [here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/linux.html).  
**Note:** Feel free to install Miniconda instead of Anaconda. I myself prefer minimal installations and **Miniconda** has just the right amount of functionality.

Change your current working directory to the project root and execute the following command to setup a Conda environment with the required libraries to run the project.

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
