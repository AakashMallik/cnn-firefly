## Data
The data must conform to the following rules:
- Data folder name should be an alphanumeric sequence following the rules of variable naming in python
- Each data folder should have a train.csv, validation.csv and test.csv
- Each csv should carry the class ID, the image file path and a unique ID as a bare minimum
- Once created, the csv files should not be changed to avoid data leakage
